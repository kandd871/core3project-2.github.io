With BBBiXXXEL we want to celebrate pixel based fonts in every form. Pixel fonts are fun and easy to design and can thus be an accessible entry to type design. Our first steps in type design were pretty pixelated for sure :-)

In this spirit we’ve prepared four of our own fonts and asked our two friends Daniel and Bronko to share theirs so we can have a release rush of six consecutive days. We got it all: an All-Caps Font, some smaller and bigger families and of course variable fonts. Make sure to come back every day between 31st May and 5th June to collect them all!

We hope you’ll enjoy using the fonts as much as we enjoyed drawing them <3

Lobbby24 is an open source typefoundry.

We want Lobbby to be an accessible platform for type design, which allows us to autonomously publish fonts. We’re also acting as a collective, collaborating on typefaces, helping each other out and giving feedback on a regular basis.

All our fonts are open source and free under the SIL Open Font License.
We encourage designers to not only use them but to make them fit their projects by editing, distorting and extending our typefaces.

Lobbby24 is Simon Marcio Bretz, Hannes Brischke and Florian Budke.

We are always happy to hear from you and your projects, so feel free to write us an email or follow us on instagram.
